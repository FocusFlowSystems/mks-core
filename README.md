Mendelsohn Kernel Standard (MKS) v2.0A normative architecture for building reliable, auditable Institutional Multi-Agent Systems."Agents are not tools. They are institutional actors."1.0 The Problem: Value AlignmentMost AI agent frameworks focus on Capability: Can the agent do the task?MKS focuses on Governance: Should the agent do the task, and did it follow our values?In high-stakes environments—whether that is Medical, Financial, or Theological—a hallucination is not a "bug"; it is a violation of trust. The Principal-Agent Problem dictates that if you have to double-check every output for safety, the agent creates more work than it saves.2.0 The Solution: MKS ArchitectureMKS solves this by wrapping probabilistic LLMs (Kernels) in a deterministic runtime (Orchestrator).2.1 The Core ComponentsKernels (The Cells): The atomic unit of agency. Not just a prompt, but a state object with Identity, Axioms, and Gates.Orchestrator (The Hardware): A deterministic Python runtime. It parses logic gates and enforces rules. It does not "think"; it obeys.Culture Stack (The Rules): A hierarchy of norms.[0] Global: Core Values/Safety (Overrides all).[1] Domain: Contextual Rules (e.g., Tone, Style).[2] Local: Task-specific prompt instructions.Immune System: A Generator-Critic loop. No worker output touches the outside world without passing an Auditor Kernel check.3.0 Quick Start (Wind Tunnel)The mks_core.py file contains a reference implementation and a "Wind Tunnel" simulation using a Theological Integrity scenario.PrerequisitiesPython 3.8+No external dependencies required for the core (Standard Lib only).Run the Simulationpython mks_core.py
What You Will SeeThe simulation runs a scenario where a PULPIT_CO_PILOT agent tries to draft content.Attempt 1: The agent drafts content that is readable but Theologically Unsound (Axiom Violation).Result: The Auditor rejects it immediately.Attempt 2: The agent fixes the theology, but writes it at a PhD Level (Gate Violation: Accessibility).Result: The Orchestrator blocks it (Too complex for general audience).Attempt 3: The agent simplifies the language while maintaining truth.Result: PASS.4.0 The ProtocolKernels communicate via strict MKS_MESSAGE envelopes. No unstructured chat.{
